AI is taking over the world. And, you can either take a backseat. Or, invest your time in learning it. Here's my 𝟱-𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝘂𝗹𝗮 📚 on how I gain deep intuition of 𝗦𝗢𝗧𝗔𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 and 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 👇

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭 - 💡 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗤𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗹𝘆

When you want to cook a dish, what's the first step? You have to know what ingredients to pick up.

To understand a SOTA model like Stable Diffusion, start by gathering the essential components that make up the algo.

- Forward Diffusion Process
- Variance Scheduling
- Markov Chain
- Reverse Diffusion Process
- UNet
- Parameter Sampling
- Attention Mechanism

Once you have your "ingredient", you now have a map of the building blocks you need to understand how the pieces fit together for the overall model process.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮 - ✍️ 𝗗𝘄𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗵

I can't emphasize this enough. Knowing how to apply the algorithm with a Tensorflow library is just the tip of the iceberg.

If you want a deep intuition of SOTA model, find a coffee shop and work out the math in matrix form step-by-step.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯 - ⌨️ 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝘁

Import tensorflow or import torch, and play around with the algorithm on a toy problem.

Browse Githubs, Medium, Kaggle, or Hugging Face for implementations.

Copy the code, play around with the parameter values, and input a new dataset and observe the output.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰 - ✅ 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵

Andrej Karpathy shares this a lot, and it's also something I've been doing since I became a practitioner in ML 7 years ago. And, it's what I've done for all the popular types of ML algos (e.g. XGBoost, RNN, Diffusion Models)

Code it from scratch - see how far you could go in each level.

Level 1 - Use tensorflow/torch
Level 2 - Only use numpy
Level 3 - Only use vanilla python

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱 - 📝 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗶𝘁

The best way to learn is to teach. Write about it. Talk about it. Share your learning with the world so others could learn.

(𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟲) - 🎯 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗦𝗢𝗧𝗔

Learning never stops. Continue to make progress in growing your knowledge in ML/AI.

The Top 8 API Architectural Styles You Should Know in 2023



REST (Representational State Transfer): A champion of simplicity and ubiquity, REST is an architectural style that primarily leverages HTTP methods. It enables easy interaction with resources, making it a go-to pattern for a multitude of applications and modern APIs.

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): SOAP, a heavyweight contender in the API arena, thrives on complexity and power. It employs XML for defining structured communication. Although requiring a SOAP client and server, it compensates with its strength and robustness, much like a well-built off-road vehicle tackling rugged terrains.

GraphQL: A rising star in the API cosmos, GraphQL offers flexibility and precision. It lets clients ask for exactly what they need, reducing redundancy, and improving performance. Think of it as a personal shopper - you get just what you asked for, nothing more, nothing less.

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call): gRPC is the speedster of the API universe. Running on HTTP/2 and using binary data, it's all about performance and speed, especially for microservices architectures. It's like a high-speed train, ensuring quick and reliable communication.

WebSockets: If real-time and bi-directional communication is what you need, WebSockets are the answer. Ideal for chat applications, live streaming, and real-time data exchange, it's like having an open telephone line between clients and servers.

Webhooks: Webhooks are the town criers of the digital world. They notify clients when certain server-side events occur, making them perfect for event-driven architectures. Imagine them as your personal alert system, keeping you informed of what matters.

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport): MQTT is a lightweight messenger, designed specifically for environments with limited resources, low bandwidth, and unreliable networks. Picture it as a postal worker determined to deliver your mail, come rain or shine.

AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol): A robust and standardized protocol, AMQP excels in middleware environments with its reliable messaging capabilities. It's like a well-oiled assembly line, efficiently moving messages where they need to go.

Which API architectural style should you use?

The best API architectural style for a particular application will depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as  -


1. The type of data that will be exchanged between the API and the client
   
2. The performance requirements of the API
   
3. The security requirements of the API
   
4. The scalability requirements of the API

Once you have considered these factors, you can start to narrow down your choices and choose the API architectural style that is best suited for your application.

𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗚𝗣𝗧 and most LLMs all contain the 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲. How does it work? Let's understand the main idea👇

Remember RNN models? They were once the most popular architecture on a host of sequence-to-sequence problems like text translations and summarizations.

But, RNNs contained a number of issues, and it was largely driven by the fact that RNNs use a hidden state to encode relationships between previous and current inputs to generate predictions. And, this hidden state is dependent on the hidden state of the previous timestamp.

And, there lie the major issues:

🔹 Vanishing Gradient - Given the dependence of prior hidden states, the gradient of the loss function with respect to weights diminishes to 0.
🔹 Long-Range Dependencies - Inputs earlier in the sequence are underweighted in predicting outputs.
🔹 Inefficiency Computation - Dependency of hidden state from previous steps makes the model training unparallelizable.

So, the Transformer model introduced the 𝗔𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗺, which replaces the hidden state with Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). The Q, K, V are matrices composed of input x weights.

And, these function like a database to perform a feature selection by doing a fuzzy match between a query and the most relevant keys, and then weighing the values based on the match scores. (I will follow up more on the math via video/post)

The model still needs to understand which input in the sequence comes first. So, another component introduced is 𝗣𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝗻𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴. Simply put - this is a pre-computed matrix where the values are generated from sin and cosine functions based on row and column indices. Summing this positional encoding to the input vector encodes the temporal relationship among inputs in a sequence.

In the overall Transformer model, there are other components like encoder-decoder model structure, residual connection, normalization, embedding layers, and feed-forward layer.

Mastering Large Language Models: A 7-Step Learning Journey

1️⃣ Understanding the Basics
If you’re new to the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), it’s beneficial to begin with a high-level overview to grasp their significance and power. Let’s start by addressing some fundamental questions:

➡ What exactly are LLMs?
➡ Why have they gained such widespread popularity?
➡ How do LLMs differ from other deep-learning models?
➡ What are the common use cases for LLMs?

2️⃣ Exploring LLM Architectures
Now, as you progress in your exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs), it’s essential to focus on the foundational transformer architecture that underlies these remarkable models. In this phase of your journey, Transformers demand your full attention, and there’s no wordplay intended here.

3️⃣ Using Pre-trained LLM
Now that you’ve established a foundational understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the underlying transformer architecture, it’s time to delve into the concept of pre-training these models. Pre-training is the bedrock upon which LLMs are built, as it exposes them to vast corpora of textual data, equipping them with the ability to grasp the intricacies of language.

4️⃣ Fine Tuning LLM
Following the initial pre-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) on extensive text corpora, the subsequent imperative task is fine-tuning, which tailors these models to specific natural language processing tasks. Fine-tuning is instrumental in adapting pre-trained models for tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering, or translation, enhancing their precision and efficiency.

5️⃣ Alignment and LLM Post-Training
Large Language models have the potential to produce content that might be problematic, biased, or not in line with user expectations. Aligning an LLM refers to the process of harmonizing its behavior with human preferences and ethical standards. This endeavor seeks to minimize the risks associated with model behavior, such as biases, contentious responses, and the generation of harmful content.

6️⃣ LLM Evaluation and Continuous Learning
After fine-tuning a Language Model (LLM) for a specific task, it’s crucial to assess its performance and plan for ongoing learning and adaptation. This step is vital to ensure that your LLM remains effective and up-to-date.

7️⃣ Building and Deploying LLM Applications
Once you’ve developed and fine-tuned a Language Model (LLM) for specific tasks, it’s time to move forward with creating and utilizing applications that make the most of the LLM’s capabilities. In other words, let’s explore how to harness LLMs to construct practical real-world solutions.

🗄️ Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

➢ RAG is a technique that enhances language model generation by incorporating external knowledge, and thus, also helps with mitigation of hallucination within LLMs.

➢ It has many variants and applications such as:
 - Vector Databases: For semantic retrieval with dense embeddings.
 - Graph Databases: Focused on extracting entity relationships for precise retrieval.
 - SQL Databases: For more structured data queries.

➢ MuRAG - Multimodal Extension: MuRAG expands RAG to include images and structured data, significantly enhancing multimodal question-answering capabilities.
