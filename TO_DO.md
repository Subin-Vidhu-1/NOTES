AI is taking over the world. And, you can either take a backseat. Or, invest your time in learning it. Here's my 𝟱-𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝘂𝗹𝗮 📚 on how I gain deep intuition of 𝗦𝗢𝗧𝗔𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 and 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 👇

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭 - 💡 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗤𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗹𝘆

When you want to cook a dish, what's the first step? You have to know what ingredients to pick up.

To understand a SOTA model like Stable Diffusion, start by gathering the essential components that make up the algo.

- Forward Diffusion Process
- Variance Scheduling
- Markov Chain
- Reverse Diffusion Process
- UNet
- Parameter Sampling
- Attention Mechanism

Once you have your "ingredient", you now have a map of the building blocks you need to understand how the pieces fit together for the overall model process.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮 - ✍️ 𝗗𝘄𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗵

I can't emphasize this enough. Knowing how to apply the algorithm with a Tensorflow library is just the tip of the iceberg.

If you want a deep intuition of SOTA model, find a coffee shop and work out the math in matrix form step-by-step.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯 - ⌨️ 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝘁

Import tensorflow or import torch, and play around with the algorithm on a toy problem.

Browse Githubs, Medium, Kaggle, or Hugging Face for implementations.

Copy the code, play around with the parameter values, and input a new dataset and observe the output.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰 - ✅ 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵

Andrej Karpathy shares this a lot, and it's also something I've been doing since I became a practitioner in ML 7 years ago. And, it's what I've done for all the popular types of ML algos (e.g. XGBoost, RNN, Diffusion Models)

Code it from scratch - see how far you could go in each level.

Level 1 - Use tensorflow/torch
Level 2 - Only use numpy
Level 3 - Only use vanilla python

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱 - 📝 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗶𝘁

The best way to learn is to teach. Write about it. Talk about it. Share your learning with the world so others could learn.

(𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟲) - 🎯 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗦𝗢𝗧𝗔

Learning never stops. Continue to make progress in growing your knowledge in ML/AI.
