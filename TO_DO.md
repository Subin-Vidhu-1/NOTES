ðŸ“º The best Stanford, CMU, and MIT courses for AI (with YouTube playlists)

- With a multitude of AI courses available online, coming up with an study plan for AI can easily lead to decision fatigue.
- I often get asked about which courses have been useful to me to build a foundation in AI. Hereâ€™s my list of courses along with their respective YouTube playlists.
- Check out my watch list with all of the below pointers (and a much larger list of such resources and more): https://aman.ai/watch

MLOps is the DevOps for machine learning.

It streamlines the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle by integrating best practices from the software development world.

This ensures that machine learning models are not just built, but are also effectively deployed, monitored, and managed in production.

It includes:
1. Continuous Integration (CI): Automated testing of ML code and pipelines.
2. Continuous Delivery (CD): Automate model deployment processes.
3. Model Versioning: Track and manage different versions of models and data.
4. Model Monitoring: Keep an eye on model performance and health in real-time.
5. Model Retraining: Ensure models stay relevant by retraining them with new data.
6. Scalability & Serving: Efficiently serve models to handle real-world traffic.
7. Collaboration: Tools for team collaboration and reproducibility across ML workflows.

MLOps ensures reliable and faster delivery of high-quality ML models to production.
