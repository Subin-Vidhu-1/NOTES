AI is taking over the world. And, you can either take a backseat. Or, invest your time in learning it. Here's my 𝟱-𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝘂𝗹𝗮 📚 on how I gain deep intuition of 𝗦𝗢𝗧𝗔𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 and 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 👇

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭 - 💡 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗤𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗹𝘆

When you want to cook a dish, what's the first step? You have to know what ingredients to pick up.

To understand a SOTA model like Stable Diffusion, start by gathering the essential components that make up the algo.

- Forward Diffusion Process
- Variance Scheduling
- Markov Chain
- Reverse Diffusion Process
- UNet
- Parameter Sampling
- Attention Mechanism

Once you have your "ingredient", you now have a map of the building blocks you need to understand how the pieces fit together for the overall model process.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮 - ✍️ 𝗗𝘄𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗵

I can't emphasize this enough. Knowing how to apply the algorithm with a Tensorflow library is just the tip of the iceberg.

If you want a deep intuition of SOTA model, find a coffee shop and work out the math in matrix form step-by-step.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯 - ⌨️ 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝘁

Import tensorflow or import torch, and play around with the algorithm on a toy problem.

Browse Githubs, Medium, Kaggle, or Hugging Face for implementations.

Copy the code, play around with the parameter values, and input a new dataset and observe the output.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰 - ✅ 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵

Andrej Karpathy shares this a lot, and it's also something I've been doing since I became a practitioner in ML 7 years ago. And, it's what I've done for all the popular types of ML algos (e.g. XGBoost, RNN, Diffusion Models)

Code it from scratch - see how far you could go in each level.

Level 1 - Use tensorflow/torch
Level 2 - Only use numpy
Level 3 - Only use vanilla python

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱 - 📝 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗶𝘁

The best way to learn is to teach. Write about it. Talk about it. Share your learning with the world so others could learn.

(𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟲) - 🎯 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗦𝗢𝗧𝗔

Learning never stops. Continue to make progress in growing your knowledge in ML/AI.

The Top 8 API Architectural Styles You Should Know in 2023



REST (Representational State Transfer): A champion of simplicity and ubiquity, REST is an architectural style that primarily leverages HTTP methods. It enables easy interaction with resources, making it a go-to pattern for a multitude of applications and modern APIs.

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): SOAP, a heavyweight contender in the API arena, thrives on complexity and power. It employs XML for defining structured communication. Although requiring a SOAP client and server, it compensates with its strength and robustness, much like a well-built off-road vehicle tackling rugged terrains.

GraphQL: A rising star in the API cosmos, GraphQL offers flexibility and precision. It lets clients ask for exactly what they need, reducing redundancy, and improving performance. Think of it as a personal shopper - you get just what you asked for, nothing more, nothing less.

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call): gRPC is the speedster of the API universe. Running on HTTP/2 and using binary data, it's all about performance and speed, especially for microservices architectures. It's like a high-speed train, ensuring quick and reliable communication.

WebSockets: If real-time and bi-directional communication is what you need, WebSockets are the answer. Ideal for chat applications, live streaming, and real-time data exchange, it's like having an open telephone line between clients and servers.

Webhooks: Webhooks are the town criers of the digital world. They notify clients when certain server-side events occur, making them perfect for event-driven architectures. Imagine them as your personal alert system, keeping you informed of what matters.

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport): MQTT is a lightweight messenger, designed specifically for environments with limited resources, low bandwidth, and unreliable networks. Picture it as a postal worker determined to deliver your mail, come rain or shine.

AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol): A robust and standardized protocol, AMQP excels in middleware environments with its reliable messaging capabilities. It's like a well-oiled assembly line, efficiently moving messages where they need to go.

Which API architectural style should you use?

The best API architectural style for a particular application will depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as  -


1. The type of data that will be exchanged between the API and the client
   
2. The performance requirements of the API
   
3. The security requirements of the API
   
4. The scalability requirements of the API

Once you have considered these factors, you can start to narrow down your choices and choose the API architectural style that is best suited for your application.
